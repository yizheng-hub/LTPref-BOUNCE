Given the previous calculation error resulting in a PMV of -2.27, which is too low, we will increase the air temperature and MRT by approximately 6.5°C to bring the PMV closer to the target range.\n\nAction:\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"Do you prefer a slightly cool indoor environment where you might feel comfortable with a light sweater or long sleeves on, but not so cold that you need additional layers?\",\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"air_temp\": 26.0,\n    \"mrt\": 26.0,\n    \"humidity\": 40,\n    \"air_vel\": 0.1\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: The adjustment made here is based on the assumption that increasing the air temperature and MRT by 6.5°C would help achieve a PMV within the desired range. However, without specific PMV calculations, this is an approximation. Further adjustments may be necessary based on actual PMV calculations using a reliable PMV calculator."
