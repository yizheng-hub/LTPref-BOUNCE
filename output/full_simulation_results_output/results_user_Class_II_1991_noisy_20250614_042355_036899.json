Given the previous calculation error, let's aim for a more precise adjustment.\n\nAction:\n```json\n{\n  \"question\": \"Do you prefer an indoor environment that feels quite cold, requiring you to wear warmer clothing like a sweater, but still comfortable enough to avoid shivering?\",\n  \"scenario\": {\n    \"air_temp\": 23.7, // Adjusted from 22.5°C\n    \"mrt\": 23.7,     // Adjusted from 22.5°C\n    \"humidity\": 40,\n    \"air_vel\": 0.1\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis adjustment brings the air temperature and MRT closer to the ideal range while ensuring the environment remains comfortably cold according to the user's preferences."
